# **Trivia Game**

This project uses a Trivia api to pull in a bunch of random trivia question.  The score is calculated by adding points for correct answers and subtracting for incorrect answers.  A running total of the score is shown to the user while they are playing.  I used 3 different methods to pull in the question using the api.  There is a corresponding button for each method.  I added a Christmas countdown to the main page to display some other information to the user.  I hope you enjoy the Trivia and good luck, some of the qustions are very difficult.

**Here are the features I added to meet project requirement.**

1. Retrieve data from a third-party API and use it to display something within your app.
2. Calculate and display data based on an external factor (ex: get the current date, and display how many days remaining until some event)
 - Countdown to Christmas
3. Need to add 1 of the other features.

I have been running my project using Go Live Server built into Visual Studio Code.

This project uses a Trivia api to pull in a bunch of random trivia question.  The socre is calculated by adding points for correct answers and subtracting for incorrect answers.  A running total of the score is shown to the user while they are playing.  I used 3 different methods to pull in the question using the api.  There is a corresponding button for each method.  I added a Christmas countdown to the main page to display some other information to the user.  I hope you enjoy the Trivia and good luck, some of the qustions are very difficult.
